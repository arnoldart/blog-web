# Modern State Management in React

State management is a crucial aspect of React applications. Let's explore different state management solutions and understand when to use each one.

## Built-in State Management

### useState

Perfect for simple component-level state:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useReducer

Better for complex state logic:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

## Context API

Great for sharing state across components without prop drilling:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

## External State Management Libraries

### When to Use Redux

- Large applications
- Complex state interactions
- Need for middleware
- Time-travel debugging

### Zustand

Simple and lightweight alternative:

```jsx
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

## Best Practices

1. Start with built-in solutions
2. Consider the scale of your application
3. Keep state as local as possible
4. Document your state management decisions
5. Use dev tools for debugging

## Conclusion

Choose the right state management solution based on your application's needs. Don't overcomplicate things - sometimes useState and Context API are all you need.
